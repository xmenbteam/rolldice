# rolldice

A dice roller I made using TypeScript and Inquirer.

To run the project locally, run `yarn`.

To globally install the project:

```bash
npm install -g ./rolldice-<version>.tgz
```

To update the project, update the version number in package.json to something else and run `npm pack`, before running the global install above.
